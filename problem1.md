### Hello World.

Let's write an app that we will call Hello World.

Our client is asking for the following features:

1. The user should be able to input a name and a language.
   * The output should be something like:
    * "Hello, Brian!"  or "Hello, Mary!"
    * ```"<greeting>, <name>!"```
    * Languages requested support are English, Hebrew, and Spanish. 
    * nonenglish greetings are : 
    * Hebrew: Shalom
    * Spanish: Hola
2. If the user doesn't choose a language, then English is assumed.
3. If a user doesn't choose a name, then the word "World" is assumed.
